abstract="In this chapter we shall consider a subfamily of the family of context-free languages known as the regular languages. The family of regular languages over an alphabet V is the smallest family of languages over V that contains all finite languages over V and is closed under the operations closure, concatenation and finite union. We shall consider three equivalent ways of describing regular languages, namely regular expressions, finite automata and regular grammars. These are ``equivalent'' in the sense that each defines precisely the same family of regular languages. Moreover, there exist algorithms for transforming any regular expression, finite automaton or regular grammar into an equivalent language description belonging to either of the other two classes.",

abstract="In many occasions would one encounter the task of maintaining the consistency of two pieces of structured data that are related by some transform --- synchronising bookmarks in different web browsers, the source and the view in an editor, or views in databases, to name a few. This paper proposes a formal model of such tasks, basing on a programming language allowing injective functions only. The programmer designs the transformation as if she is writing a functional program, while the synchronisation behaviour is automatically derived by algebraic reasoning. The main advantage is being able to deal with duplication and structural changes. The result will be integrated to our structure XML editor in the Programmable Structured Document project.",
